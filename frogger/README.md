# Claude Game

Welcome! This repo is your workspace for today's session.

## What's here

This repo has two things:

1. **A working Snake game** built with TypeScript and [PixiJS v8](https://pixijs.com/)
2. **A compound engineering workflow system** — a set of commands that help you use Claude systematically on real projects

Before you start building, get familiar with both:

- **[Snake Game Docs](docs/snake-game-docs.md)** — How the game works, the engine/scene architecture, how to run it
- **[Compound Engineering Docs](docs/compound-engineering-overview.md)** — The five workflow commands, how the agents and knowledge loop work
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — Architecture reference (Scene interface, Renderer API, constants)

## Your challenge

**Transform the Snake game into a completely different game using the compound engineering workflow.**

Be as ambitious as you want. Breakout, Asteroids, a platformer, a puzzle game, a roguelike — whatever you're excited about. The engine handles the game loop, rendering, and input out of the box — leave it as-is if it suits your needs, or modify it if your game calls for something different.

## How to start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, in Claude Code (start a new conversation with `/clear` between each step):

1. `/workflows:brainstorm` — figure out what game you want to build
2. `/workflows:plan` — let Claude research the codebase and create an implementation plan
3. **Review the plan** — read it, make sure the approach makes sense
4. `/workflows:work` — execute the plan
5. `/workflows:review` — run a multi-agent code review on your changes
6. `/workflows:compound` — document what you learned so future plans get smarter

Each command writes an artifact that the next one finds automatically. Clearing between steps keeps your context clean.

While Claude is working on a long step, open a new terminal tab and start another Claude conversation — ask questions about the workflow system, explore the code, think about your design.

Iterate as needed. Each cycle through the pipeline makes the next one better.
