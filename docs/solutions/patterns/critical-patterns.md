## 1. Scene Interface Is the Only Engine-Game Contract (ALWAYS REQUIRED)

### WRONG (Will break engine/game separation)
```typescript
// Game logic directly imports engine internals
import { Application } from "pixi.js";
import { Input } from "../engine/Input.js";

class MyScene implements Scene {
  private app: Application; // DON'T access PixiJS directly

  update(dt: number) {
    // DON'T use variable time — dt is always 0.15s
    const now = Date.now();
    this.move(now - this.lastTime);
  }
}
```

### CORRECT
```typescript
import type { Scene, GameContext, Renderer } from "../engine/types.js";

class MyScene implements Scene {
  private gridSize = 0;

  init(context: GameContext) {
    this.gridSize = context.gridSize; // Get config from context
  }

  update(dt: number) {
    // Use the fixed dt directly — it's always 0.15s
    this.position += this.speed * dt;
  }

  render(renderer: Renderer) {
    renderer.drawRect(this.x, this.y, 1, 1, 0xff0000); // Grid coords
    renderer.stage; // Escape hatch if you need raw PixiJS
  }

  onKeyDown(key: string) { /* handle input */ }
  onKeyUp(key: string) { /* handle release */ }
  destroy() { /* clean up */ }
}
```

**Why:** The Scene interface is the default contract between engine and game layer. When working within this contract, use it properly (get config from GameContext, use fixed dt, draw through Renderer). Bypassing it unintentionally (e.g., using Date.now() instead of fixed dt) leads to bugs. However, students are free to modify the engine layer if their game needs different behavior.

**Placement/Context:** Applies whenever creating a new Scene implementation. If the engine needs changes, modify it deliberately rather than working around it from the scene side.
